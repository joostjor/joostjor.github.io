## Hi there!
I am a Ph.D. Candidate at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/) in the Stochastics Group since the summer of 2018,
where I work under the supervision of [Dr. Júlia Komjáthy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~jkomjath/) and [Prof. Dr. Remco van der Hofstad](https://www.win.tue.nl/~rhofstad/).
My position is funded by [NWO Science](https://www.narcis.nl/research/RecordID/OND1367443).

The main focus of my Ph.D. is on *distances* in Random Graphs, and in particular *Preferential Attachment Models*.
While my work is mostly theoretical, applications can be found in e.g. spreading of epidemics, fake news, and computer viruses.

Before I started my Ph.D. I was a Data Scientist/Operations Research Engineer at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
Here, I also learned to value more applied side of Mathematics, but also of Computer Science and Software Engineering.

In my spare time I love to play the piano (mostly jazz music). At the moment, I play in a cover band, a jazz quintet, and a piano (jazz) trio.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Discrete probability
- Preferential Attachment
- (Spatial) Random Graphs
- Percolation
